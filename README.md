# Smart_Parking_System
Users can then access this information through a web or mobile application to find available parking spaces.
Designing an IoT-based car parking management system using Arduino can help in efficient parking space utilization. 
In this system, we'll use Arduino boards to monitor the occupancy status of parking spaces and transmit this data to a central server using a Wi-Fi module.
Components Required:

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno or Arduino Mega)
Ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04 or similar)
Wi-Fi module (ESP8266 or ESP32)
Breadboard and jumper wires
Power supply (battery or USB cable)
